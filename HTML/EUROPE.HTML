                <img src="../MEDIA/ImageMapping/France.jpg" style="float: left;">
                <blockquote>France entices people of all ages with some of the world’s most iconic landmarks, world-class art and architecture, sensational food, stunning beaches, glitzy ski resorts, beautiful countryside and a staggering amount of history. There’s the city’s romantic image, the stunning architecture, the Louvre museum, the iconic Eiffel Tower as well as the simple pleasure of sitting at a café terrace and watching the world go by. European and US visitors have flocked here from all the world for many years, and they keep coming back and in recent years the appeal of Paris has gripped the far east, with more and more Chinese nationals coming to get a glimpse of the Champs Elysées and its array of boutiques. Paris is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating and beautiful cities on earth. With glamorous buildings, chic cafés and more galleries than you could ever visit, Paris will captivate your heart and soul. France’s scenery is as diverse as it is beautiful, with the glittering coastlines of the French Riviera, the patchwork fields of the Loire Valley, the snow-capped Alps and centuries old harbor towns of Normandy. This, of course, is hugely appealing for lovers of the great outdoors. Rather than choosing between mountains and beaches, France offers both and a whole lot more. France’s history is etched into every street corner. Visit the Loire Valley to see and explore a multitude of castles sitting majestically behind perfectly manicured gardens.</blockquote>
