                    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing this today so I can remind you tomorrow that I passed through today and you will pass through tomorrow. As of now, I am struggling meeting my own packed schedules and deadlines. How about you? Have you done your to do list? or should I say you randomizer list? I mean, we both know that we just do whatever we feel like doing but that’s how we finish our work.(Our little secret.) This is just who we are.<br><br>But, I am not here to congratulate you for passing through me. I am here to feel sorry for you because you experienced the me that you could have avoid but because of indecisiveness, we lost it. Just kidding! Congratulations for passing yesterday.We both are still in second year college but I know you do much better than me because well, you learned from the best which is me. I apologize if you are doing much work because of my laziness but I promise I’ll do better.<br><br>Tomorrow me, I am currently struggling with the rain of emotions and academic pressure. I might give up now but I will make you my inspiration. It’s not selfish to choose you over me because I know I will benefit from you. I am currently in the student life over personal life situation ,and as of now, Acads first before anything else. So tomorrow me, do me a little favor.<br><br>Whisper to our more tomorrow mes that we have done our very best, that surving is not merely but is a hard work, that choosing our future us is better than being stuck with our inner child. Do you best! Be brave , and always chase your dreams away even if coding makes us burn out.
