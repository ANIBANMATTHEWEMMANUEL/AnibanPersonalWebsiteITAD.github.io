I am also an <strong>open-minded person.</strong><sup>5</sup> I always listen to what my peers tells and give proper feedbacks and opinions.<sup>6</sup> Another skill is my stress tolerance is high.<sup>7</sup> I can work under pressure.<sup>8</sup> My ability to be flexible in any circumstances is another asset of mine.<sup>9</sup>  As a matter of fact, me being flexible is a skill that I developed  from my childhood.<sup>10</sup>  In my high school days, I was the <q><strong>captain ball</strong></q> of our varsity team and a part of the school dance troupe.<sup>11</sup> Being the captain ball was not easy because I have to discipline and guide my teammates on and off the court.<sup>12</sup> We didn't have a proper coach because our school does not support our basketball team.<sup>13</sup> The school only funded the volleyball team that's why we don't have a support system for our team.<sup>14</sup> Our dance troupe was quite the opposite.<sup>15</sup> It was supported by the director and principal of our school.<sup>16</sup> Another skill of mine is basically my <strong>knowledge in computers</strong>.<sup>17</sup> Having <strong>basic computer skills</strong> is an essential in every aspect.<sup>18</sup> <strong>God has given us all a gift of unique skills</strong>.<sup>19</sup> My skills might be the same of different with your skills, but, we can work together and use it to make a positive difference in the lives of others.<sup>20</sup> </p></blockquote></div>
