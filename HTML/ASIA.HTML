                <blockquote><h2>3. Seoul, South Korea</h2></blockquote>
                <img src="../MEDIA/ImageMapping/seoul.jpg" style="float: left;">
                <blockquote>Seoul is riding a wave of creativity. From fashion to food, architecture to art, the city has become a creative haven for those looking to make their mark. It's packed with trendsetting residents who have helped create a future-proof city that still honors its distinctive past. South Korea’s capital might be home to some 10 million people, but you can easily escape the crowds by enjoying the city’s wide range of outdoor opportunities. Add some real adventure to your trip by heading to Bukhansen National Park, which is just a 45-minute subway ride away from central Seoul. Here, you’ll find hiking trails for all levels, including the Bukhansanseong path, which takes walkers to the summit of South Korea’s tallest mountain, Baegundae. You’ll also find several idyllic green spaces dotted across the city, including the Seoul Forest, which produces picture-perfect cherry blossoms in the spring. While Seoul is arguably the most thrilling city in South Korea, it's not the only large city that's worth a visit. Despite its small size, South Korea has plenty of exciting cities from north to south. </blockquote>
