                <blockquote><h2>1. Easter Island</h2></blockquote>
                <img src="../MEDIA/ImageMapping/easter.jpg" style="float: left;">
                <blockquote>Alongside its extraordinary cultural heritage, Easter Island has a great wealth of natural riches with extinct volcanoes, lava tunnels and caves that were formed by volcanic eruption, and a rugged coastline of cliffs and hidden bays. The island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, which were created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. Easter Island is most famous for its mysterious monolithic stone statues. Known as moai, these statues are believed to have been carved by the Rapa Nui people sometime between 1250 and 1500, depicting the faces of their ancestors. Around half of the Moai are at the Rapa Raraku site but many that were originally there have been moved to other spots along the coastline and positioned facing inland. Guided tours take visitors around the island to see the ancient statues up-close.</blockquote>

                <blockquote><h2>3. Machu Picchu</h2></blockquote>
                <img src="../MEDIA/ImageMapping/Picchu.jpeg" style="float: left;">
                <blockquote>The consensus opinion is that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the great Inca Pachacuti. It is also considered a pilgrimage site that Incas would take to pay respects to the great Inca leader. The pilgrimage taken to the site is the route now called the Inca Trail. Tucked away in the rocky countryside northwest of Cuzco, Peru, Machu Picchu is believed to have been a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders, whose civilization was virtually wiped out by Spanish invaders in the 16th century. The consensus opinion is that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the great Inca Pachacuti. It is also considered a pilgrimage site that Incas would take to pay respects to the great Inca leader. The pilgrimage taken to the site is the route now called the Inca Trail. At a dizzying 2,430 meters above sea-level, the view form Machu Picchu on a clear day is breath taking. The famous ruins are surrounded by towering peaks (apus, which means “sacred peaks” in Quechua) and have views of the surrounding valley. </blockquote>
